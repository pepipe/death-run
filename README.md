# Death Run 
Game created for GameDev GameJam 2022.

### Art Instructions
Because I cannot distribute some of the free art in the project there's 
a need to do some steps so you can build the project.

- Skybox: Get [AllSky](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/allsky-free-10-sky-skybox-set-146014) asset. Open 2DRunner scene, in Lighning window set the enviorment Skybox material to Deep Dusk Equirect.

### Art Credits 
I didn't create any of the art used in the game. All was possible because of the kind people listed below (in no particular order):
